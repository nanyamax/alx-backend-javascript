Not having tests in your app is a pain because chances are every time you make slight adjustments to your app you have to manually check every single part of your app to see if anything broke. Writing tests, however, also feels for the most part a chore. But we definitely need them

With automated tests you donâ€™t have to test all the workings of the app every time you change something in your enormous and still growing app. This means that when you are adding or modifying parts of your app, you will have a lot more confidence in the reliability of your code. Which is undeniably reassuring.
